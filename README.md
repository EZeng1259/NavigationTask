# Navigation Task 

This repository contains the files to a navigation task in Unity. The navigation tasks consists of the Traveling Salesman Problem in a virtual marketplacement environment. The goal is to study variances of spatial and temporal memory on navigation and free recall ability. 
The environment consists of buildings and trees (to hinder the observability of the environment). There are 19 special buildings with a red banner. The objective is to visit all 19 buildings in the shortest route possible. Each building has a unique name. 
Each participant is given 8 trials to complete the same task, starting from the same location. Data such as the coordinates and building visited order are collected. At the end of the trials, a free recall task is given, and participants must recall the names of the building they have encountered.
